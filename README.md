## Inspiration
Students are tired of back and forth emails to schedule video calls everyone in their group can attend. Teachers are fed up with unproductive students. We have decided to create this app to mitigate the scheduling problem for high school and university students. Schedula is an application that focuses to help high school and university students with scheduling using their existing Google Calendar information. This increases student productivity by finding common times for students when most of their peers are available. Teachers will be able to assign groups based on the matching availability of students, thereby allowing for greater productivity.  

## What it does
Schedula finds common times when the most number of students in a specified group are available in real-time. Schedula's algorithm extracts the Google Calendar of each user in the same group. The software then selects the appropriate times when the majority of all users are available. If, for instance, there were four members in Group A, Schedula would first optimize when all four users are available. Then all three, then two, then one. The darker shades of red indicate the most ideal times, when all four members are available. As the shade of red gradually decreases to lighter shades, less members become available for the specified time. 

## How we built it
> We used Javascript and HTML & CSS for the application, and we implemented technologies from our sponsors like Github for storing code and Domain.com for our domain name. We initially decided to use React but due to technical difficulties, we transitioned to Javascript and HTML & CSS.

## Challenges we ran into
> React, our team had some experience with coding frontend and backend but we had never used a framework like react which was a challenge. At first we absolutely hated it as we made no progress but as we were using the tool we started getting accustomed to it. This was definitely a major challenge in the beginning of the hackathon.
> Time. Time is a challenge we ran into, we wanted to go the extra mile to add that one tiny detail to our project which will take it to the next level, but because of nature of hackathons and having limited time we were not able to do that.
> A challenge that we faced was time management. We had a lot of things we wanted to do with this idea, but the power outage and Github bug deleting half our code held us up and made our project quite rushed. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
> One of my accomplishments was contributing to the overall development of the project. Though this was my first hackathon, and first project as well, I learned new skills very quickly and I'm very proud that we were able to make a good final product. **-Fiona**

> Having limited coding and hackathon experience, participating in Jamhacks allowed me to learn from my peers. Our group featured backend developers, frontend developers, designers, and public speakers, with all our strengths complementing each other and pitching into our idea. **- Sarah**

## What we learned
> We learned about new pieces of technology such as react router, which we were able to effectively implement into our product. Throughout the learning process, we discovered which sources and technologies worked best for us, and how to efficiently utilize programs such as GitHub. Additionally, we incorporated new sources such as Domain.com to enhance our final product. 

## What's next for Schedula
As a concept, we believe that Schedula has great potential in the future. With more development time, it could be integrated into school boards and universities across the nation. 

We hope that Schedula can include more platforms and collect data from calendar-based platforms like Microsoft Outlook Calendar and Apple Calendar. We hope to integrate Schedula into other socializing platforms such as finding students with matching availabilities for study sessions on Discord.
